# 🔰 What is System Design?

## ✅ Definition
System design is the process of **planning the architecture** of a software system that can **handle user needs** (like traffic, storage, performance, etc.) efficiently.

> 🔧 It's like being the architect of a building – before building, you draw plans and consider structure, plumbing, electricity, future expansion, etc.

## 🌟 Why Learn System Design?

- Crack FAANG/MAANG interviews 🧠
- Build scalable apps like Instagram, YouTube, Zomato 🍔
- Collaborate better with backend/frontend/devops teams 🤝
- Understand trade-offs (Speed vs Cost, Consistency vs Availability) ⚖️
- Make tech decisions as a software architect or senior engineer 🧹
- Handle millions of users and massive datasets with ease 🚀

## 🧠 Types of System Design

| Type              | Focus Area                     | Example                        |
|-------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| High-Level Design | Overall system architecture     | Load balancers, API Gateway    |
| Low-Level Design  | Internal components & classes   | Database schema, service flow  |

## 🏗️ Real-World Analogy: Zomato Example

Imagine designing **Zomato**:

- Users visit → browse restaurants → place orders → get notifications.

Behind the scenes, you need:

- Web servers
- Databases
- Notification systems
- Recommendation engines
- Caching, Logging, Monitoring, etc.

> **System design** means deciding how all these pieces **fit together** so the app runs **smoothly**, **quickly**, and **reliably**.

| Concept              | Description                                       |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Load Balancer        | Distributes traffic among servers                 |
| API Gateway          | Entry point for client requests                   |
| Cache                | Fast-access storage (e.g., Redis, Memcached)     |
| Database (SQL/NoSQL) | Stores persistent data                           |
| Queue (Kafka, RabbitMQ)| Handles asynchronous tasks (e.g., emails)      |
| CDN                  | Delivers static content quickly                   |
| Sharding             | Splits data across databases                      |
| Replication          | Makes copies of data for high availability        |
| Rate Limiting        | Prevents abuse of services                        |
