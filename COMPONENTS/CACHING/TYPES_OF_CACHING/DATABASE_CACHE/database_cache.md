### 📚 Database Cache

#### 🔍 What is Database Cache?
A Database Cache is a temporary storage layer that sits between your application and your database. It stores frequently accessed data in memory (RAM), so that when the same data is requested again, it can be delivered faster without querying the database every time.

#### 💡 Why Use Database Cache?
#### 1. Speed
- Memory access is much faster than disk/database access. By storing data in memory, you significantly reduce the time taken to retrieve data.

#### 2. Reduce Load
- Caching reduces the number of times your application queries the database, which lowers the load on the database server.

#### 3. Cost-Efficient
- Fewer database calls mean reduced cloud/database usage costs, which makes caching a great solution for scalable and cost-effective systems.

#### 4. Scalability
- By offloading frequent queries from the database, caching allows your system to handle more users without slowing down the app, thereby improving scalability.

#### 🔄 How It Works (Step-by-Step)
#### Example Scenario: Showing User Profile by ID
- First Time Request:

- The application asks the database:
- “Give me data for user ID = 101”

- The database returns the data:
{name: "Aakash", age: 22}

- The application then stores this data in the cache for future use.

- Next Time Request (Same User):

- The application checks the cache first:

- It finds the data in the cache.

- Instead of querying the database again, the app directly serves the data from the cache ➡️ faster response.

#### 🚀 Benefits of Database Caching
- Reduced Latency: Data is retrieved from memory, resulting in much faster response times.

- Reduced Database Load: With caching, fewer database queries are required, easing the load on your DB server.

- Cost Savings: By reducing database load and the number of queries, caching can help lower your cloud or database service bills.

#### 🛠️ When to Use Database Cache?
- Frequently Accessed Data: Use cache for data that doesn’t change often, like product details, user profiles, etc.

- High Traffic Applications: In apps with heavy traffic, caching helps reduce load times and keeps the database from getting overwhelmed.
